                    Richard Zare Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your feet 
                    or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries special 
                    chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can tell scientists where the molecules that compose 
                    a substance are from, where they traveled and what happened to them along the way. But doing these analyses 
                    has been complex and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new method to make isotopic analysis 
                    easier and less expensive.

                    Lindy Hop instruction Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement—but life in the Stanford 
                    dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford’s Dance Weekend in Roble Gym 
                    offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco 
                    hustle, Bollywood and blues fusion.
